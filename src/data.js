        desc:"A dosa, also called dosai, dosey, dwashi or dosha is a thin pancake in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black lentils and rice. Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar. ",

        longDesc:"In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants.[4] The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.[5] A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants.[4] The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker.

        desc:"A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a special sauce, often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.",
        longDesc:"The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich"

        desc:"A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the Indian type and the Southeast Asian type.[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called mongoes, the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion",
        longDesc:"Mango is native to India and Southeast Asia, and people have cultivated it for over 4,000 years. Hundreds of types of mango exist, each with its own characteristic taste, shape, size, and color"
